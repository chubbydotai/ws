        <h1>Chubby.Ai</h1>

            <p>Abundance All-Round.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>

            <p>Help feed, house, and self-actualize humans.</p>

        <h2>What problem exists?</h2>

            <p>There are somewhere between 750,000 to 1 million homeless humans in the USA on a given night.</p>

            <p>According to Realtor.com, the USA market was short 4 million homes in 2024.</p>

            <p>There has been a major push for domestic USA manufacturing as the AI / humanoid robotics race with China accelerates.</p>

            <p>There are roughly 2 billion humans or 1/4 of the planet without adequate access to toilets and clean water.</p>

            <p>There will be an additional 2 billion people on the planet within the next 25 years.</p>

            <p>AI investment is accelerating end-to-end, creating power limited data centers.</p>

            <p>Data center and manufacturing capacity align with more people and housing developments.</p>

            <p>There are roughly as many school districts as municipalities, yet half as many post-secondary institutions.</p>

            <p>Lack of post-secondary education facilities are limiting for human intelligence in a similar way that lack of electricity generation facilities is limiting for artificial intelligence. There are nearly twice as many utility scale power generating facilities as Title IV post-secondary institutions, with a major push to build more. No such push for higher education exists at such scale.</p>

            <p>Without planning, communities sparked by economic development can have disastrous consequences to quality of life for all involved.</p>

            <p>We need to build manufacturing and data center capacity for AI and humanoids to be of the most value to humans. Locality of that space matters.</p>

            <p><b>Simplified:</b> We need AI driven factories, higher education, and town infrastructure decentralized around the USA and abroad.</p>

        <h2>What is the Chubby.Ai solution?</h2>

            <p>We are building Chubby MOM, a network of 1,000 Chubby Centers -- 1MW (small data centers by current AI industry standards) EDGE Factory-Datacenters, allowing us to seed 1,000 one-hundred to two-thousand acre Chubby Towns -- Factory College Towns around the USA.</p>

            <p>This is how we build millions of homes, while also planning out the neighborhoods for a high quality of life.</p>

            <p>Building a distributed and decentralized supply chain infrastructure for food, housing, data centers, electronics, robotics, and everything else for human needs to be met.</p>

            <p>This is simple, turn land into buildings and infrastructure. We are building housing for happier humans and facilities for businesses to thrive.</p>

            <p>AI abundance won't come overnight, it is a long-term collaboration of humans and machines, as it has been for the entire industrial revolution.</p>

            <p><b>Simplified:</b> We are building a supply chain advanced enough for humanoid robotics and AI compute, but also focused on basic human needs. We are building small manufacturing data centers that seed into building 100-2,000 acre sidekick towns dedicated to manufacturing, education, and affordable quality housing. These are meant to assist and complement surrounding areas.</p>

            <p>Scale 10x to 100 Chubby Center Factory-Datacenter locations.</p>

            <p>Scale 10x again to 1,000 Chubby Center Factory-Datacenter locations. This is Chubby MOM, the Modular Omni Mind, a nationwide AI manufacturing computer dedicated to helping feed, house, and empower humans to live, work, play, love, learn, and pay-it-forward. Chubby MOM is important for leasing income, manufacturing capacity, and for using the compute ourselves as-needed.</p>

            <p>Chubby House -- Human assisted Factory and Robotic Fabricated Homes, from 200 to thousands of square feet.</p>
        
            <p>We begin construction on Chubby Towns -- Factory College Towns, as more complex planning and approval processes are completed. Without focusing on single properties, we can move quicker and more efficiently. These sidekick mini-towns are a planned way to expand our capacity while having a positive impact on surrounding communities.</p>

            <p>From edge AI to entire towns, we're building a backbone for tomorrow's innovation.</p>

        <h2>Why Chubby.Ai?</h2>

            <p>We are creating our own manufacturing supply chain during build-out.</p>

            <p>The AI revolution demands speed, proximity, and reliability. Centralized AI cloud requires entirely new electricity infrastructure that takes years of approvals and build-outs for massive campuses that deeply impact surrounding areas. That's where we come in.</p>

            <p>Nationwide Coverage: 1,000 strategically placed data centers across the USA, connected by a high-speed fiber grid.</p>

            <p>Edge AI Optimized: Built for inference, training, and real-time analytics -- right where you need it.</p>

            <p>Scalable Power: 1MW data centers -- designed to expand with growing demands of our clients, as well as adjusting to abundant electricity pockets.</p>

            <p>Lower Latency: Process data closer to the source, when time is critical.</p>

            <p>Lower Environmental Impact: We blend in with the environment by utilizing compact footprints.</p>

            <p>This allows AI to impact human lives WITH those humans.</p>

            <p>We are on a mission to feed, house, and empower human needs. This is truly about human fulfillment long-term, while helping our supporters make good reliable money in the process.</p>

        <h2>The Chubby.Ai Advantage: We Build Real World Infrastructure.</h2>

            <p>We're not just infrastructure -- we're a partner in unlocking AI's potential for human abundance.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision: Chubby Town</h2>

            <p>"Abundance All-Round" is our motto, because we believe human abundance is possible and necessary with intelligence scaled by high-performance compute.</p>

            <p>With a nationwide factory and data center network, it enables us to build a redundant and automated supply chain in the USA.</p>

            <p>We build, sell, and lease computers. Computers with extremely high performance accelerated. We do this in our Factory-Datacenters.</p>

            <p>With Factory-Datacenters, we unlock Factory College Towns, where we build, sell, and lease housing, educational and research facilities, factories, parks, roads, and everything else included in Factory College Towns.</p>

            <p>Mission of 1 Billion Humans Fed, Housed, and Empowered to Live, Work, Play, Love, Learn, and Pay-it-forward in our towns by 2050.</p>

            <p>We see a world where multiple groups like us come together to solve these global issues impacting basic human needs.</p>

        <h2>What are our core values?</h2>

            <p>Our mission is simplified into meeting human needs based on theories summed up by Maslow's Hierarchy and Tony Robbins 6 Human Needs.</p>

            <p>Maslow's Hierarchy</p>
        
            <p><u>Physiological:</u> air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing, reproduction.</p>

            <p><u>Safety:</u> personal security, employment, resources, health, prosperity.</p>

            <p><u>Love and belonging:</u> friendship, intimacy, family, sense of connection.</p>

            <p><u>Esteem:</u> respect, self-esteem, status, recognition, strength, freedom.</p>

            <p><u>Self-actualization:</u> desire to become the most that one can be.</p>

            <p>These are the core values that we look to for inspiration to empower humans to reach self-actualization. Each value is followed by the Tony Robbins Human Need.</p>

            <p>Live Happy, Healthy, and Selflessly Abundant with Faith: <u>Certainty</u></p>

            <p>Work with Passion to Solve Problems and Serve Others: <u>Significance</u></p>

            <p>Play Hard: <u>Uncertainty/Variety</u></p>

            <p>Love Harder: <u>Love/Connection</u></p>

            <p>Learn and Grow through Curiosity: <u>Growth</u></p>

            <p>Pay-it-forward with Gratitude: <u>Contribution</u></p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>

            <p>We have a 3,500 sq ft building and roughly 6,500 sq ft building side-by-side.</p>

            <p>Our first efforts go toward assembling compute that we sell for a profit.</p>

            <p>We assemble our own compute and pre-lease for the prototype data center as we have our fiber run.</p>

            <p>As more funding comes in or sales of compute, we build out more.</p>

            <p>We continue to scale over time using this Factory College Town concept of more manufacturing capacity, more educational research facilities, and more town infrastructure including farm land.</p>

            <p>We have an initial Chubby Center Factory-Datacenter under construction (Michigan) and are scouting 10 pilot locations around the USA, with 100+ more breaking ground as those come online. Full deployment of Chubby MOM (1,000 Factory-Datacenters) + a network of 1,000 Chubby Town Factory College Towns producing 1 million homes annually by 2030 (oversimplified example: 1,000x1,000 = 1 million housing units).</p>

        <h2>How does Chubby.Ai help 1 billion humans by 2050 when it's only helping 1 million by 2030?</h2>

            <p>1 million housing units produced in 2030 with our supply chain.</p>

            <p>50 million housing units produced in 2035 with our supply chain accelerated with Chubby MOM + Chubby Town supply chain compounding annually.</p>

            <p>15 years multiplied by 50 million = 750 million housing units with a minimum of 1 billion humans fed, housed, and empowered.</p>

            <p>Perfect scaling is unlikely, here is simply doubling our capacity annually in 2031 (2 million new homes), 2032 (4 million new homes), 2033 (8 million new homes), 2034 (16 million new homes), and 2035 (32 million new homes).</p>

            <p>This can be achieved with AI, automation, humanoid robots, and humans working together to make it happen.</p>

            <p>$100 Trillion is taking 1 billion humans and multiplying that by $100,000. It is the theoretical infrastructure value on a human being part of a Factory College Town that we build.</p>

        <h2>How can you help?</h2>

            <p>Join the mission, help us build. We have a place for anyone that is willing to put in the work.</p>

            <p>Share the mission, we need people to know about our purpose.</p>

            <p>Invest in the mission.</p>

        <h2>Is this risky?</h2>

            <p>Of course, it's a bet on AI and humanity collaborating together for an abundant future. AI could plateau, global war could break out, global disease could happen, anything could happen, but this is having a simple faith that humanity will continue to advance through technological innovations.</p>

            <p>The failures of the past, did not have this mission or timing. Plain and simple. We are betting on the idea that, data centers and compute have continued to grow in demand for the entirety of the internet, AI has accelerated this. Amazon makes 60% of their operating profits from their data center business, yet many people believe they are an online shopping business first. The top 6 companies by market capitalization in the USA are data center or compute companies in one form or another.</p>
