        <p>Powering the Future of AI at the Edge.</p>

        <p>Welcome to Chubby.Ai -- where real-time intelligence meets unparalleled scale. We're building a network of 1,000 cutting-edge, 1MW factory-datacenters across the United States, delivering low-latency AI compute to every corner of the nation.</p>

        <p>From autonomous vehicles to smart cities, we're building a backbone for tomorrow's innovation.</p>

        <p>Get in Touch (<a href="https://x.com/chubbydotai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/chubbydotai</a>)</p>

        <h2>Why Chubby.Ai?</h2>

        <p>The AI revolution demands speed, proximity, and reliability. Centralized AI cloud requires entirely new electricity infrastructure that will take years of approvals and buildouts for massive campuses that deeply impact surrounding areas. That's where we come in.</p>

        <p>Nationwide Coverage: 1,000 strategically placed datacenters across the USA, connected by a high-speed fiber grid.</p>

        <p>Edge AI Optimized: Built for inference, training, and real-time analytics -- right where you need it.</p>

        <p>Scalable Power: 1MW datacenters, designed to expand with growing demands of our clients, as well as adjusting to available electricity pockets.</p>

        <p>Low Latency: Process data closer to the source, slashing delays and costs.</p>

        <p>Low Impact: We blend in with the environment by utilizing compact footprints.</p>

        <h2>The Chubby.Ai Advantage</h2>

        <p>We're not just infrastructure -- we're a partner in unlocking AI's potential.</p>

        <p>For Enterprises: Accelerate IoT, 5G, and autonomous systems with edge-native compute.</p>

        <p>For Innovators: Deploy AI workloads seamlessly, from coast to coast.</p>

        <p>For a Smarter World: Enable everything from precision agriculture to urban mobility.</p>

        <p>With a $1 billion post-money valuation and a clear path utilizing both debt and equity to a 1,000 location -- $20 billion nationwide buildout, Chubby.Ai is redefining what's possible at the edge.</p>

        <h2>Our Network</h2>

        <p>1,000 factory-datacenters: Compact, efficient, and purpose-built for AI.</p>

        <p>Fiber Backbone: 100,000+ miles of high-capacity fiber, linking every node in multiple directions.</p>

        <p>Redundant &amp; Resilient: Engineered for uptime, security, and scale.</p>

        <p>We have an initial factory-datacenter under construction (Michigan) and 10 pilot locations breaking ground in 2025, with 100+ more breaking ground in 2026. Full deployment by 2030.</p>

        <h2>Backed by Visionaries</h2>

        <p>Chubby.Ai is fueling pilot factory-datacenters starting with a $98M SAFE Seed Round by 100 cofounder-investors, valuing us at $1B post-money with an additional Series A of $100M. Our investors believe in a distributed future -- and so do we. Join industry leaders betting on the edge.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        <p>"Abundance All-Round" is our motto, because we believe human abundance is possible and necessary with intelligence scaled by accelerated compute.</p>

        <p>With a nationwide factory and datacenter network, it enables us to build a redundant and automated compute supply chain in the USA.</p>

        <p>We build, sell, and lease computers. Computers with extremely high performance accelerated. We do this in our factory-datacenters.</p>

        <h2>Ready to Connect?</h2>

        <p>Whether you're a customer, partner, or innovator, let's build the future together.</p>

        <p>Enterprises: Deploy AI at scale.</p>
